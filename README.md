# Twisted Empress
You seek to defeat the Twisted Empress that has become corrupt. In order to do so, you must venture through to inner land to the castle. Several threats will appear, which you must vanquish to free the kingdom from her power.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository as a .zip folder
2. Extract the zip folder
3. Open the *twisted-empress-main* folder in Visual Studio Code (make sure it is the folder that has the repository in it and does not contain a twisted-empress-main folder)
4. Run and enjoy!

> Note: you must have the python and pygame modules installed in Visual Studio Code or it will not work. 

# How to Play

*The game is unfinished, so some of the discussed features may not be implemented*

There are three powers to choose from:

### **Power of Lionheart**
Holds the Sword of Courage, the warrior class. (Will have) the higest HP, but the least MP
* Basic: A melee strike. Must be on enemies to deal damage. Diagonal attacks work best.
* Special: A fierce burst strike releases as 2 separate projectiles. Costs 1 MP. The next basic attack becomes empowered with three attacks instead of one.
*Tips: The attacks vary based on mouse position. Move the mouse close to the player. It requires skill to masterfully angle the attacks to clear waves easily.*

### **Power of Odyssey**
Holds the Bow of Adventure, the archer class. (Will have) the highest damage, but the least HP.
* Basic: Shoots an arrow.
* Special: A fast burst of three shots pierce through several enemies. Costs 1 MP. The next basic attack does double damage.
*Tips: Use your special closer to enemies so all three bullets hit them. Like Lionheart, the angle varies based on mouse position. The closer to the player, the more spread out. Diagonals aid the bullets to clump together.*

### **Power of Acuity**
Holds the Staff of Knowledge, the mage class. (Will have) the most spells and MP, but the least damage.
* Basic: Shoots an orb of energy as a projectile.
* Special: Shoots a burst of three agile orbs that pierces through enemies (similar to Power of Odyssey). 
*Tips: Don't use Acuity right now! Currently without spells, its powers are not yet as strong.*

## Controls
* WASD to Move
* Left Click to Basic Attack
* Right Click to Special Attack | Costs 1 MP
* Space to Dash (while moving) | Costs 1 MP
* Shift to Guard | Costs 1 MP if not Lionheart
* Scroll to select spell (*not implemented*)
* Middle Click to cast spell (*not implemented*)

## Areas and Levels
In the game, there are four levels. Currently, there are only two enemies for simplicity. However, each area will have various different enemies (with some reappearing ones!).

### The Meadows
The first area. The design depicts a lush, vibrant area. As the game progresses, the areas become more and more thematic. This is the initial area to show the vibrancy and the beautiful, retro pallete of the game.

### The Desert
The second area. The design is extremely simplistic, with no path. This is an antithesis level that takes elements of game design. Without a set path, now the player is shown that the desert is vast and not linear; easily able to get lost if off track. The enemies here are very simple. However, the boss is where things pick up. Mainly requiring memory, the Guardian is very complex regarding the attack patterns.

### The Enchanted Forest
The third area. Taking inspiration from the first level, this forest is extremely sinister, with a white framed gate. The dull look is intentional as to not confuse the player with the several tricky and complex enemies there are. Mechanically, this is the hardest section due to the sheer difficulty spike. From what the player has experienced, the scenery matches the tone that the player is in for a not-so-good time.

### The Castle
The castle is the scariest part of the game. The enemies are insanely challenging. Don't drop your guard, this is the **heart** of the game! You are now reaching end game, and this is not intended to be a walk in the park. You are trespassing! The blue tone is meant to represent the royalty and also be quite thematically different from the previous areas. It is very roguelike in its look.

### The Heart
Immediately after The Prince battle, is two rooms of complete white. Complete. White. This is extremely jarring considering the darker themes for ALL of the levels. The Empress knows that everything has been vanquished, and that you are the cause. In a beautiful, poetic way, the final boss encounter with the Twisted Empress depicts that the Empress is not-so-twisted at all. In these times, it is easy to blame the people of power. So then, are you the villain? The final boss fight flips the morals of the fights, now showing the *true colours* of the kingdom. With all three powers, the Empress uses attacks from all previous bosses. This is an almagamation that truly takes the form of a good final boss.

# Bosses (Coming Soon!)

Currently, the bosses have not been implemented as they will be highly complex to defeat with attack patterns and desperation moves that require memory or reflex skills, with limited attack windows.

### The Rogue
The Rogue will be a shock factor to the game. As a first boss, this won't be a walk in the park (not even close!). WIP!
The Rogue's desperation moves consist of using its clones to attack in consecutive timings. One of these DM's would be a circle of clones that encloses onto you, and sends barrages of shurikens around for several loops! 
### The Guardian
The guardian is very slow, but has a lot of fast-paced sections with a lot of memory. To defeat this boss, one must learn and master its attacks. WIP!
### The Wizard (WIP)
The wizard will warp reality, shifting to different dimensions upon being hit. With several spells, this is what the Power of Acuity aspires to be. WIP!
### The Prince (WIP)
The prince will hone onto your biggest weaknesses, trigonometry! WIP!
### The Empress
The Empress will be a fast paced amalgamation of all that was taught. WIP!
